RHP - Ruby Hypertext Preprocessor


Authors:

Dependencies:
  rhp
  |
  +- ruby 1.8    <http://www.ruby-lang.org/>
  |
  +- gcc or similar c compiler
  |
  +- ruby-fcgi   <http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/fcgi>
     |
     +- fcgi headers
        These can be aquired in several ways. On Debian/Aptitude there is
        a package suffixed with "-dev" which installs fcgi headers. On Mac OS X/MacPorts
        there's a package named "fcgi" wich will install the library as well as the headers.
        These headers may not be needed, depending on if you build ruby-fcgi yourself or
        installs a prebuilt package.
  
  And also a FastCGI-capable web server. (For example Lighttpd and Apache)
