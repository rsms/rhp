Simple example hosted by lighttpd.

To run, cd to this directory (in which you found this README file) and run:

  lighttpd -Df lighttpd.conf

Then enter http://localhost:8080/ to see it running.
You may now fiddle around a bit with index.rhp and foo.rhp!

Note: If you do not have *sbin in your path, you may have to specify the 
      absolute location of lighttpd. Ie /usr/sbin/lighttpd
